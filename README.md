# Loyalty Rewards Service

# General Info 
This is a Points web service that accepts HTTP requests and returns responses. This web service provides routes that allow users to: 
* Add transactions for a specific payer and date
* Spend points and return a list of { "payer": <string>, "points": <integer> } for each call
* Return all payer point balances.
  
# Problem Statement
  Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes we actually track their
points per payer/partner. In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date).
For earning points it is easy to assign a payer, we know which actions earned the points. And thus which partner should be paying for the points.
When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are
spent. There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
  
* We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
* We want no payer's points to go negative.
  
The web service must
Provide routes that:
* Add transactions for a specific payer and date.
* Spend points using the rules above and return a list of { "payer": <string>, "points": <integer> } for each call.
* Return all payer point balances.
  
Example
Suppose you call your add transaction route with the following sequence of calls:
* { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 1000, "timestamp": "2020-11-02T14:00:00Z" }
* { "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": 200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T11:00:00Z" }
* { "payer": "DANNON", "points": -200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T15:00:00Z" }
* { "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": 10000, "timestamp": "2020-11-01T14:00:00Z" }
* { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 300, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T10:00:00Z" }
  
Then you call your spend points route with the following request:
{ "points": 5000 }
  
The expected response from the spend call would be:
  
[
{ "payer": "DANNON", "points": -100 },
{ "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": -200 },
{ "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": -4,700 }
]
  
A subsequent call to the points balance route, after the spend, should returns the following results:
  
{
"DANNON": 1000,
"UNILEVER": 0,
"MILLER COORS": 5300
}

# Features
* Main
  * Main class which starts up the Points Service
* Points
  * A JavaBean which represents points
* PointsAfterSpending
  * The PointsAfterSpending class is a JavaBean that contains the payer and points. It is used to store the number of points left after the spendPoints endpoint is called.
* PointsManager
  * Contains all the logic for spending points and getting point balance for all payers.
  * Add transaction: A method used to add the specified transaction to the list of transactions
  * Spend Points: This method contains the logic for spending points. It takes into account the requirements which state that the oldest points must be spend first and that no payer's points go negative.
  * Get balance: This method returns a map. The key is payer and the value is the point balance for the payer.
* Transaction
  * A JavaBean that represents transactions. Each transaction contains a payer, points, and timestamp for the transaction.
